                OUR PHILOSOPHY
              </h2>
              <h4 className="font-size-subheader mb-4">
  Shofrica is founded on the idea that beauty should complement and empower the dynamic life you lead.

  When we envisioned what we wanted Shofrica to be, we asked ourselves - what would the most amazing luxury beauty brand look like in ten years? We concluded that the future of beauty would be super clean, perform at the highest luxury level, welcome everyone who loves beauty, help people fuel their lives inside and out, be sustainable, transparent, digital-first, cruelty-free, and created by women (naturally). This is the vision behind Shofrica. We are a work in progress and a brand in motion.

  Developed through Mulinge Mutua's unique perspective, these are the products we felt were missing from your makeup bag — cleanly formulated, high performance beauty solutions for the modern individual who lives life on-the-move and to the fullest. <a href="https://shofrica.com/" target="_blank" className="cjs-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">shofrica.com</a>.

              Mulinge Mutua launched his eponymous fashion label in 2015, growing it from a small capsule collection into a global brand with flagship boutiques in Berlin and Frankfurt. In fall 2016, Mulinge Mutua expanded his focus to beauty with a makeup collaboration with Sita Harries. The collection was a success and a second followed the next year. It was during this time that Mulinge Mutua met Sarah Creal, then an Estée Lauder executive. Working together, the two discovered a shared beauty philosophy and passion for clean products with luxurious ingredients. In 2019, they teamed up to create Shofrica, a streamlined collection of clean, high performance products.
